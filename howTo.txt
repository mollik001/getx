GetX basic file format:

  -lib
    -app
      -data
      -modules
        -home(modules can be any single feature of the app)
          -binding
            -home_binding
          -controller
            -home_controller
          -view
            -home_view
      -routes
    -main.dart

this is the basic file format when using GetX.


Differences between Put and LazyPut:

the primary difference between put and lazyPut is the timing of the dependency instance creation.
put creates the instance immediately, while lazyPut defers the creation until the first access.
The choice between them depends on whether you want to eagerly initialize the dependency or 
delay its creation until it's actually needed.
